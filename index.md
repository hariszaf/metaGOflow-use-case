[metaGOflow](https://github.com/emo-bon/MetaGOflow) is a pipeline based on [MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/) and its [workflows](github.com/ebI-Metagenomics/pipeline-v5), 
aiming to address the challenges of the analysis of the European Marine Omics Biodiversity Observation Network (EMO BON) data. 
[EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon) is a long-term omics observatory of marine biodiversity that generates hundreds of metagenomic samples periodically from a range of stations around Europe.


Here we show visual components accompanying the metaGOflow publication (cite). 
We performed all steps of metaGOflow for a marine sediment sample () and here is the taxonomic inventories based on LSU and SSU.
